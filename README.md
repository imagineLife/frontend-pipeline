# A Pipeline for a Frontend Repo
## Pre-Reqs
- react
  - frontend SPA with react (not the focus here)
- testing
  - run frontend unit tests in dev mode here with `npm run test`
    - dev mode leaves test runner running, listening for file-changes in the terminal, ready to run tests over and over during development
  - run frontend unit tests in prod mode here with `CI=true npm run test`
    - prod mode runs the tests 1x & exits the test runner process
